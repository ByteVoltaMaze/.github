## 🏆 About the Competition

The **RoboCup Rescue Maze** is one of the most advanced categories in RoboCup Junior. Fully autonomous robots must operate in complex scenarios that simulate real-world disaster zones.

Robots are required to:
* **Explore** unknown labyrinths.
* **Identify** victims using specialized sensors and computer vision.
* **Map** the environment in real-time.
* **Navigate** uneven terrain and avoid obstacles.
* **Execute** decisions without any human intervention.

This challenge demands seamless integration between **Mechanics**, **Embedded Electronics**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Advanced Navigation Algorithms**.
